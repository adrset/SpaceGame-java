# SpaceGame-java
This is a java project of a 3 dimensional space game.
The game was created by Adrian Setniewski and Przemys≈Çaw Nowak - polish students of the faculty of physics at Warsaw Univerity of Technology.
The project contains some code from LWJGL tutorials - we still learn! :)
We would like to thank Mr ThinMatrix from youtobe, who made creating this game possible for us.
